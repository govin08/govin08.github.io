# first

Consider a plain $\mathbb R^2$.
For some unit vector (that we would call 'the principal unit tangent vector') $T(s)$, we can rotate $T(s)$ by $\frac\pi2$ to get $N(s)$ (that we would call 'principal normal tangent vector').
It is elementary to show that $T(s)\cdot T'(s)$ so that there exists a real number $\kappa(s)$ such that $T'(s)=\kappa(s)N(s)$.
We call $\kappa$, the (signed) curvature.
It follows that

$$\kappa(s)=\kappa(s)N(s)\cdot N(s)=T'(s)\cdot N(s).$$

And I'll do some computation, starting from $T(s)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$.
Surely, $\theta$ is a function of $s$.
Then
$$
T'(s)=\frac{d\theta}{ds}(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)
$$

Consider a plain $\mathbb R^2$.
For some unit vector $T(s)$ (that we would call 'the principal unit tangent vector'), we can calculate $N(s)$ by

$$
N(s) = \frac{T'(s)}{\lvert T'(s)\rvert}
$$

that we would call 'the principal normal tangent vector'.
It is elementary to show that $T(s)\perp T'(s)$ so that there exists a real number $\kappa(s)$ such that $T'(s)=\kappa(s)N(s)$.
We call $\kappa(s)$, the (signed) curvature.
It follows that

$$\kappa(s)=\kappa(s)N(s)\cdot N(s)=T'(s)\cdot N(s).$$

And I'll do some computation, starting from $T(s)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$.
Surely, $\theta$ is a function of $s$.
Then
$$
T'(s)=\frac{d\theta}{ds}(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)
